<!-- 
  The Server Element defines properties for the individual
  installation of NG/AMS. 

  Attributes:
    ArchiveName:            Name of the archive - e.g. ESO-VLT.

    PortNo:                 Port number to use for the NG/AMS HTTP server.

    SwVersion:	            If defined, NG/AMS will compare the value of
                            this attribute with the version ID of NG/AMS.
                            If these are not completely identical an error
                            is reported and the NG/AMS Server will perform
                            an exit. If the SwVersion is not specified
                            (set to ""), this check is not done.

    BlockSize:              Block size applied when receiving and
                            sending data via HTTP (bytes).

    Simulation:             Simulation system "1" otherwise "0".

    MaxSimReqs:             Maximum number of simultaneous requests that
                            the server should be capable of handling.
			    If more are received, these will be rejected.

    MountRootDirectory:     Base directory used as root directory when
                            mounting the disks.

    ProxyMode:              If a server which is contacted with a Retrieve
                            Request, finds a file to be retrieved, on 
                            another NGAS Host, it will act as proxy and
                            send back the file to the requestor if possible.

  Attributes:
    StorageSetId:       ID used to refer to this particular 
                        storage unit (string).

    Mutex:              Indicates if mutual exclusion access should be

                        one data reception session will write data to
                        that slot (disk), and not simultaneous as otherwise

  The DataCheckThread Element defines properties for the file handling.

  Attributes:
   ChecksumPlugIn:        DCPI - Data Checksum Plug-In, which generates the
                          checksum of a data file.

   ChecksumPlugInPars:    Input parameters to the DCPI.

   Active:                Enable/disable Data Check Service (1 = activate).

   ForceNotif:            If set to 1, an Notification Message will always
                          be sent out when a checking cycle has finished,
			  also if no descrepancies were encountered.

   MaxProcs:              Specify the maximum number of parallel sub-processes
                          are allowed to carry out the data checking.

   Scan:                  If set to 1, only a scan of the data holding is
                          carried out. This means that it is checked if the
                          files are accessible and if their size are OK.
			  The checksum is not calculated however.

   Prio:                  Priority of Data Check Thread (1 = highest priority).
                          with this parameter it is possible to adjust the
                          amount of CPU power the Data Check Thread should 
                          consume. The higher the number, the lesser CPU
                          the check will consume. At the same time, it
                          will take more time to carry out the check of
                          the data holding.

   MinCycle:              Indicates the minimum allowed time for carrying out
                          one check cycle (ddThh:mm:ss). If this is specified
                          e.g. to 24 hours, and one check cycle would only
                          take 11 hours, the check would be suspended for
                          13 hours before running again.

   DiskSeq:               Used to indicate if disks should be checked
                          sequentially (ordered according to the Slot
                          ID), or randomly (SEQUENTIAL|RANDOM).

   FileSeq:               Used to indicate if files on a disk should be checked
                          sequentially (ordered according to the ingestion
                          date), or randomly (SEQUENTIAL|RANDOM).

   LogSummary:            If set to 1, a summary log info will be generated
                          each time a complete check of the data holding
                          of one NGAS Host has been carried out.

  The Log Element defines properties for the logging performed by
  the NG/AMS Server.

  Attributes:
    SysLog:         Switch on UNIX syslog logging (0|1).

    SysLogPrefix:   Prefix (tag) written first in the syslog entries
                    (in the data part).

    LocLogFile:     Indicates a name of a local log file. Should be
                    complete path.
 
    LocalLogLevel:  Log level for producing logs into the local 
                    log file. Must be in the interval from 0 to 5. 

    LogBufferSize:  Size of the internal log buffer (in terms of log
                    entries). This indicates how many entries are buffered
                    before the logs are purged out to the log file.

    LogRotateInt:   ISO8601 timestamp indicating how often the log file
                    should be rotated. "01T00:00:00" means every day (24h).
 
    LogRotateCache: Indicates how many rotated log files should be kept.
                    If set to 0 the log files will be deleted when the
                    log file is regenerated. A value of 30 means that
                    the past 30 log files are kept.

  The Subscription Element defines a data subscription. It will trigger
  the NG/AMS Server to subscribe itself to data from another NG/AMS Server.

  Attributes:
      HostId:             Host ID of the Data Provider.

      PortNo:             Port number used by the Data Provider.

      Priority:           Priority requested for this Subscription.
                          The lower the number the higher the priority.
                          Default is 10. If other Subscribers subscribe
                          with a higher priority then this client, they
                          will be served faster.

      SubscriberUrl:      Subscriber URL, which is issued when subscribing.
                          The Data Provider will use this URL when delivering
                          the data to the Subscriber.

      FilterPlugIn:       A Filter Plug-In applied on the data files to
                          decide whether to deliver a file to a Subscriber
                          or not.

      FilterPlugInPars:   Parameters to issue to the Filter Plug-In.
