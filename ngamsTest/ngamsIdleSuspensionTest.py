    Missing Test Cases:
    - CLONE (from suspended sub-node).
    - Check that node is not suspending itself when:
        - DCC is on-going.
        - Request is being handled.
        - Subscription data being delivered
    - Check that a node suspends itself if configured so, within
      the specified period of time.
    - Check that sub-nodes are woken up at:
        - CONFIG?<Different Combinations>&host_id
        - STATUS: Check if more relevant cases.

        Expected Result:
        After starting the server, it should suspend itself after the given

        - Start server with a configuration file specifying idle suspension
          after 10s.

          with a time-out of 20s.
