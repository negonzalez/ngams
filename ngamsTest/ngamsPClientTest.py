        Synopsis:
        Test server multiplexing feature of the Python-API/Client.
        
        Description:
        The purpose of the test is to verify the proper functioning of the
        server context switching (multiplexing) provided by the Python-
        API/Client. With this feature a list of servers + ports is given, and
        the C-API switches between the specified servers.

        A STATUS Command will be sent out to test the server multiplexing.

        Expected Result:
        After a limited number of attempts, all servers available, should
        have been contacted by the Python-Client.

        Test Steps:
        - Start simulated cluster with 5 units.
        - Submit STATUS Command invoking the Python-Client with the list of
          servers.
        - Verify that within 100 attempts, all servers have been contacted.

        Remarks:
