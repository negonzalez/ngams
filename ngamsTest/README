INTRODUCTION:
The ngamsTest sub-module contains the Unit Tests for the NG/AMS Package.

The tests are organized such that there is one Test Suite per main feature. 
E.g., there is one Test Suite for each command and a Test Suite for the
NG/AMS C-API, Archive Client and Python API. In addition for the internal
NG/AMS Server Threads like the Janitor Thread and the Data Consistency
Checking Thread.


TEST CODE STRUCTURE:
The tests source code files are named as follows: 

    ngams<Feature>Test.py

- e.g.:

    ngamsCloneCmdTest.py

In the test source file there is a Test Suite Class named as the
source file. Each Test Case in the Test Suite have a name of the form:

    test_<Test Case>_<#>

- e.g.:

    def test_CloneCmd_1(self):
        '''
        Test Case: Normal execution of CLONE Command/clone one file.
        '''
        ...


TEST TOOLS:
To execute all tests, the following command can be used:

    % python ngamsTest.py [-status] [-tests "<tst mod>,..."]


To execute a specific Test Suite the following command can be invoked, e.g.:

    % python <Test Source File> [-x] [-v <level>] 
             [-logLevel <level> -logFile <file>] [-tests <test name>] 
             [-noCleanUp]


The command line parameters are:

  -x:                    Provide extended information in case of errors.
  
  -v <Level>:            Generate Verbose Output.

  -logLevel <Level>:     Set the Log Level to be used when logging in
                         a Log File.

  -logFile  <Log File>:  Log file.

  -tests <Test Case>:    Execute a specific Test Case in the Test Suite.

  -noCleanUp:            Leave temporary test output files.


TEST ENVIRONMENT:
The tests requires the availability of an NGAS DB (Sybase ASE). This
is defined in the the NG/AMS Configuration file used for the tests.

The tests do not need any real disks/HW but are running in simulation
mode and creates a local NGAS Directory Structure in the directory "/NGAS".
