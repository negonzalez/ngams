OVERVIEW:
A plug-in is a small piece of (Python) code, which is used to customize
a generic software platform to specific contexts.

The NG/AMS Plug-Ins Sub-Module contains implementations of the various
kinds of NG/AMS Plug-Ins, which are used in operation for some of the
NGAS Sites. In addition, these plug-in implementations serve as
examples of how to implement plug-ins to customize an NG/AMS
installation to a specific context.

Common for all NG/AMS Plug-Ins is that the plug-in module must contain
a function, which has the interface and behavior as defined for that type
of plug-in. The Plug-In Function in the Plug-In Module must have the same
name. I.e.:

  - Plug-In Module:   MyXxxPlugIn.py
  - Plug-In Function: def MyXxxPlugIn(<Plug-In Pars>)


The NG/AMS Plug-In should be based on the functions contained in the
ngams/ngamsLib/ngamsPlugInApi.py module. They will also use other classes 
in ngams/ngamsLib however, like ngamsFileInfo and ngamsDiskInfo.


The various NG/AMS Plug-Ins and the corresponding example implementation 
delivered with the NG/AMS Package are:

  - Checksum Plug-In:        ngamsGenCrc32.py

  - Data Archiving Plug-In:  ngamsFitsPlugIn.py (& ngamsNgLogPlugIn.py)

  - Data Processing Plug-In: ngamsEsoArchDppi.py (& ngamsExtractFitsHdrDppi.py)

  - Filter Plug-In:          ngamsMimeTypeFilterPI.py

  - Label Printer Plug-In:   ngamsBrotherPT9200DxPlugIn.py

  - Online Plug-In:          ngamsLinuxOnlinePlugIn.py

  - Offline Plug-In:         ngamsLinuxOfflinePlugIn.py

  - Registration Plug-In:    ngamsFitsRegPlugIn.py

  - Suspension Plug-In:      ngamsSuspensionPlugIn.py

  - Wake-Up Plug-In:         ngamsWakeUpPlugIn.py


Further information about each of these kinds of plug-ins consult the specific
man-pages for each plug-in implementation. In the man-pages also the 
interfaces of the various types of plug-ins can be seen.
