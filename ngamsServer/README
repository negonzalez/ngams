OVERVIEW:
The NG/AMS Server Sub-Module (ngamsServer) contains the classes and
functions used to build up the NG/AMS Server class (ngamsServer).

The main class of the module is the ngamsServer, which implements the
services of the NG/AMS Server. The NG/AMS Server is a dedicated HTTP
server. It can handle simultaneous HTTP requests in separate threads.


To divide the code into manageable blocks, a separate source files has
been made for each command. These have names of the form:

  ngams<Command>Cmd.py

- e.g.:

  ngamsOnlineCmd.py

Functions shared by several commands are contained in source files
with names of the form: 

  ngams<Context>Utils.py

- e.g.:

  ngamsSrvUtils.py


For more information about each class and function provided by this
module, check the specific documentation for each source file.
